I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Wichita State University with a deep passion for programming and technology. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with expertise in Software Engineering, Big Database Systems, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am a research assistant working in developing Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Originally from Panauti, a small and picturesque town in Nepal, I am now based in Wichita, Kansas. My upbringing instilled in me a love for the outdoors and an adventurous spirit. I am a trail runner, having completed multiple 20 + mile races, and I’ve also proudly finished a sprint triathlon. When I’m not immersed in coding or research, you’ll often find me running, hiking, or indulging in my other hobbies—reading historical and philosophical books.

In addition to my personal and academic pursuits, I am a passionate soccer enthusiast and an ardent supporter of English Club Manchester City. I also enjoy playing soccer in my free time. My dream is to become a high-endurance athlete and a prodigy machine learning engineer. Whether on the trail, in the lab, or cheering on my favorite team, I bring dedication and energy to everything I do.
